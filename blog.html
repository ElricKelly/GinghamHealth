                <h2>DID YOU KNOW THAT MORE THAN HALF OF YOUR BODY IS MADE UP OF MICROBES?</h2>
                <p>Microbes, viruses and fungi found in the gut, make up what's known as the gut microbiome. We are home to trillions of microorganisms. Less than 1% of bacteria are pathogenic to humans. We are super organisms - walking, talking ecosystems!!
                    Microbes are all over our bodies, but 95% are housed in the gut. Microbes are key to all of our bodily functions. So, with that in mind, it seems logical to take care of them right? You can support gut healing by doing the following 5 things:<br>
                    <br>
                    1.  Remove - remove potentially inflammatory foods such as gluten, dairy and sugar.<br>
                    2.  Replace - replace any digestive supports that may be lacking such as foods rich in prebiotics to feed your beneficial bacteria.  Prebiotic rich foods include dandelion root, garlic, oats, onions or jicama.<br>
                    3.  Reinoculate - add probiotics and/or probiotic rich foods to help populate the gut with good bacteria.  Probiotic rich foods include yogurt, certain aged cheeses and fermented vegetables like sauerkraut and kimchi.<br>
                    4.  Repair - consider supplements to soothe and repair your gut such as purified aloe (not whole leaf), Omega 3 fatty acids, l-glutamine, licorice root, collagen or marshmallow root.<br>
                    5.  Rebalance - Reduce stress and balance all aspects of your life, not just the food on your plate - career, finances, relationships, etc.<br><br>

                  <p>One of the things that has stuck in my head throughout my health coach training and practice has been the concept of, "Eat The Rainbow." It is such a simple concept and easy to remember.<br>
                    It simply means that every time you eat, try to include as many brightly colored foods on your plate as you can because the colors mean something.<br>
                    The color equates to a certain trait that the fruit or vegetable has that is good for us. Below I have listed the colors and what that color represents and how it can aid our body:<br><br>
                    <span style="color: red; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Red:</span> is good for your immune system by reducing your immune response and reduces inflammation.  Examples of red fruits and vegetables:  Tomatoes (lycopene), Apples (phytonutrients), Beets (Nitrates), Cherries (Melatonin) and Strawberries.<br>
                    <span style="color: orange; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Orange:</span> is good for reproductive health and overall hormonal health.  Examples of orange fruits and vegetables:  Yams, Oranges, Tangerines, Carrots and Mandarins - all include Beta-carotin and Carotenoids.<br>
                    <span style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Yellow:</span> makes people happy because it aids in the production of serotonin.  It also helps with digestion.  Examples of yellow fruits and vegetables:  Pineapples, Bananas, Lemons and Ginger.<br>
                    <span style="color: green; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Green:</span> helps your heart, respiration and circulation - contains Folates and Vitamin K.  Examples of green fruits and vegetables:  Spinach, Avocado, Broccoli, Kale, Collard Greens and Romaine.<br>
                    <span style="color: indigo; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Blue/Purple:</span> is good for your brain health.  Examples of blue/purple fruits and vegetables:  Blueberries, Blackberries, Dried Plums, Elderberries, Plums, Figs, Grapes, Purple Potatoes, Black Olives, Eggplant, Purple Asparagus, Purple Cabbage and Purple Cauliflower.<br><br>
                    Adding just a few of these to your plate can have a lasting, positive impact on your health!<br> 
                    When you're cooking or choosing food, just remember the simple phrase, "EAT THE RAINBOW!"</p>
