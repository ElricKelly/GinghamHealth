            <h2>Meet Your Health Coach!</h2>
            <p>My name is Michelle and I have always been on a quest to eat healthier.  
                To eat in a way that sustains our planet, is less cruel to animals and aligns with what our ancestors ate.  </p>
            <p>My health and wellness path began when I was presented with the option of accepting a buyout to resign from my corporate position of fourteen years.  
                Instead of viewing this as a negative event, I chose to think of it as my chance to change my life.  
                This was my time to do something different; something meaningful that I was passionate about.  
                I had always felt that I was meant to do something greater, so I took the buyout and left my job! I embarked on an incredible journey to heal myself 
                - mind, body and spirit.</p>
                <p>
                    I am a kind, energetic, passionate, opinionated and organized person who loves to cook, hike, practice yoga, kayak, snowshoe and swim!  
                    I love riding rollercoasters and will ride all the rollercoasters in a theme park.  
                    I love being by the water and experiencing its tranquility, but also enjoying all the activities associated with the water. 
                     I love being in nature; interacting with my natural environment via all my senses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am so glad that I finally chose this career path.  
                    I know that I am where I'm supposed to be.  
                    I am confident that I can help you navigate your health and wellness hurdles!  
                    Together we can create a plan that will bring your goals to actuality.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>Not only did I want to heal myself, but I wanted to help others realize their true potential. 
                I want others to realize that they are the masters of their fate and we can all do whatever we want to do!  
                To further bring my dream to fruition,  I enrolled in the Institute for Integrative Nutrition (IIN) and I am now an Integrative Nutrition Health Coach!  I haven't looked back! </p>
                <p>
                    It has always been my dream to somehow incorporate the things I love to do into a career.  
                    For the longest time, I didn't think that was possible.  
                    I now know that it is possible....I get to do all the activities I love and help others by being an Integrative Nutrition Health Coach!!
                </p>
                <p>I have learned so much on this journey and I know that I can impart what I've learned to you.  
                    You too can change your trajectory.  
                    You can change your story and I can help you figure out how to make that happen.  
                    Are you ready to find your new path?</p>
