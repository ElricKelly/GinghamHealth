            <h2>Meet Your Health Coach!</h2>
            <p>My name is Michelle and I have always been on a quest to eat healthier. 
              To eat in a way that sustains our planet, is less cruel to animals and aligns with what our ancestors ate.</p>
            <p>My health and wellness path began when I was presented with the option of accepting a buyout to resign from my corporate position of fourteen years. 
              Instead of viewing this as a negative event, I chose to think of it as my chance to change my life. 
              This was my time to do something different; something meaningful that I was passionate about.
               I had always felt that I was meant to do something greater, so I took the buyout and left my job!
                I embarked on an incredible journey to heal myself - mind, body and spirit. 
                 Part of that journey was enrolling in a health coaching program at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. 
                  It has been amazing and enlightening.  I haven’t looked back!!</p>
                <p>
                  I am a kind, energetic, passionate, opinionated and organized person who loves to cook, hike, practice yoga, kayak, snowshoe and swim! 
                  I love riding rollercoasters and will ride all the rollercoasters in a theme park. 
                  I love being by the water and experiencing its tranquility, but also enjoying all the activities associated with the water. 
                  I love being in nature; interacting with my natural environment via all my senses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am so glad that I finally chose this career path. 
                  I know that I am where I'm supposed to be.
                   I am confident that I can help you navigate your health and wellness hurdles! 
                   Together we can create a plan that will bring your goals to actuality.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>I want to help others realize their true potential. 
              I want others to realize that they are the masters of their fate and we can all do whatever we want to do! 
              I’d like to create a community of people who are eager to change their path, eager to heal themselves with food and not pills.  
              Those individuals who want to take back their health and share their triumphs and setbacks with others. 
               It has always been my dream to somehow incorporate the things I love to do into a career. 
               For the longest time, I didn't think that was possible.
                I now know that it is possible....I get to do all the activities I love and help others by being an Integrative Nutrition Health Coach!!</p>
                <p>
                  I have learned so much on this journey and I know that I can impart what I've learned to you. 
                  You too can change your trajectory. 
                  You can change your story and I can help you figure out how to make that happen. 
                  Are you ready to find your new path?
