          <div class="testimonial">

            <p>I have known Michelle for quite some time now.  
                Michelle is a really energetic and positive person.  
                She has always been extremely health conscious and very interested in diet and exercise.  
                When she chose to leave her career to pursue her lifetime passion, I knew she would be providing a service to people that they would truly need.  
                She has continued to help me better myself through diet, exercise and mental health.  
                I am one of the few people I know, in my age group, who is not dependent on taking some form of prescription medication.  
                I equate this with following Michelle's food guidelines and diet plans!</p>

          <!-- Testimonial 2 -->
          <div class="testimonial">
            <p>I've known Michelle for several years and frequently discussed healthier options, 
                cooking methods and alternatives to work around food sensitivities while still enjoying my favorite dishes. 
                 After each conversation with Michelle, I'm excited to explore new options or methods and her encouragement always leaves me confident that I will succeed. 
                 This feeling of confidence is really what sets Michelle apart from others.  
                 I can't wait until our next meeting to share my successes, set new goals and soak in that encouragement again.</p>
